# TodoList with useReducer

In this project you will be making a simplified todo list
using useReducer hook.

Inside <code>reducers/todo.js</code>, implement your reducer logic inside the todo reducer function.
Only add actions for adding and deleting a todo.

In <code>AddTodo.js</code> file implement the component AddTodo.
<ul>
    <li>This will be the form for adding the todo, Give the form id="todo-form".</li>
    <li>Inside it make an input element with id "todo-input" which takes the title of todo.</li>
    <li>
        The actual todo object will only have two properties, one title and another id which should be 
        autogenerated when user submits todo-form(Date.now() will provide a good enough id for this use case).
    </li>
    <li>Then finally a button of type submit for adding the todo to list</li>
    <li>After successfully adding the todo reset the form fields.</li>
</ul>

In <code>Todo.js</code> file implement Todo component which will show individual todo
<ul>
    <li>Todo will have class "todo"</li>
    <li>Inside that make a div with class todo-title
    to display the title of todo</li>
    <li>Make a button with class todo-delete which upon clicking removes that todo from list of todo</li>
</ul>
